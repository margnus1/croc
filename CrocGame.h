//	Game Overview:
//	
//	You are a ranger in Wollomunga national park, in outback Australia. 
//	Crocodiles in this park have sensors attached that say where they are and the water conditions 
//	(calcium, salinity and alkalinity levels) of the water the crocodile is current swimming in. 
//	
//	The park consists of 35 waterholes, each of which is reachable only from its neighbors. 
//	
//	The park has records of the calcium, salinity and alkalinity distributions in each waterhole.
//	
//	The sensor on one crocodile, 'Croc', has broken. It no longer says where he is, however 
//	it does still provide water condition readings. You need to find Croc. 
//
//	There are also two Swedish backpackers in the park, wandering around at random visiting waterholes. 
//	If they end up in the same waterhole as Croc, they will be eaten. 
//	
//	Your score is the number of moves it takes to find Croc.

	//          (It must be reachable from your current location)

	//	-	Invalid moves will mean you do nothing.
